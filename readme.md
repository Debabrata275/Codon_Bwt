# Codon Usage Tool (Codon + BWT)

A machine learning-based codon recommendation and analysis system that combines codon usage statistics with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)-derived features to improve prediction robustness and biological relevance.

🌐 **Live Demo**: [https://codon-usage-tool.onrender.com/](https://codon-usage-tool.onrender.com/)

The system provides:
* Codon ranking for a given amino acid
* Species-level codon usage preference
* Comparison between Codon-only and Codon + BWT models
* Model performance, robustness, and training proof visualizations

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

* 🔬 **Hybrid feature engineering**: Codon usage + BWT features
* 📊 **Performance metrics**: Top-1 / Top-2 / Top-3 accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
* 🧪 **Robustness evaluation**: Clean, Noisy, and Missing data testing
* 🧠 **Pretrained ML model** (XGBoost-based)
* 🌐 **Web interface**: Flask backend + Responsive HTML/CSS/JS frontend
* ☁️ **Deployed on Render**

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Codon usage bias plays a critical role in gene expression and synthetic biology. Traditional codon analysis relies only on frequency tables and ignores sequence-level patterns.

This project enhances codon analysis by:
* Learning global codon preference patterns
* Incorporating BWT-based sequence features
* Evaluating model robustness under noisy and missing data

## 📌 Key Features

### Input
* **Amino Acid** (single-letter code, e.g., `L`, `K`)
* **Optional Codon** (RNA format, e.g., `UUA`, `UUU`)

### Output
* Ranked synonymous codons
* Top species associated with selected codon/amino acid
* Accuracy comparison (Codon vs Codon + BWT)
* Model evaluation metrics
* Robustness metrics
* Training proof plots (confusion matrix, accuracy/loss curves, feature correlations)
